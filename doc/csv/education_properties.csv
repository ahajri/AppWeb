SE.PRM.NENR,Net enrolment rate: primary: both sexes (%),Total number of students in the theoretical age group for primary education enrolled in that level: expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group. Divide the number of students enrolled who are of the official age group for primary education by the population for the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NER at each level of education should be based on enrolment of the relevant age group in all types of schools and education institutions: including public: private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes. A high NER denotes a high degree of coverage for the official school-age population. The theoretical maximum value is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified level of education. When the NER is compared with the GER: the difference between the two highlights the incidence of under-aged and over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%: then the complement: i.e. the difference with 100%: provides a measure of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified level of education. However: since some of these children/youth could be enrolled at other levels of education: this difference should in no way be considered as indicating the percentage of students not enrolled. To measure universal primary education: for example: adjusted primary NER is calculated on the basis of the percentage of children in the official primary school age range who are enrolled in either primary or secondary education. A more precise complementary indicator is the Age-specific enrolment ratio (ASER) which shows the participation in education of the population of each particular age: regardless of the level of education.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics

SE.PRM.TCHR,Teachers in primary education: both sexes (number),Total number of teachers in public and private primary education institutions. Teachers are persons employed full time or part time in an official capacity to guide and direct the learning experience of pupils and students: irrespective of their qualifications or the delivery mechanism: i.e. face-to-face and/or at a distance. This definition excludes educational personnel who have no active teaching duties (e.g. headmasters: headmistresses or principals who do not teach) and persons who work occasionally or in a voluntary capacity in educational institutions.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics

SE.PRM.TENR,Adjusted net enrolment rate: primary: both sexes (%),Total number of students of the official primary school age group who are enrolled at primary or secondary education: expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population. Divide the total number of students in the official primary school age range who are enrolled in primary or secondary education by the population of the same age group and multiply the result by 100. NERA should be based on total enrolment of the official primary school participation age group in primary and secondary education for all types of schools and education institutions: including public: private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes (pre-primary education must be excluded). NERA gives more precise measure of the participation of the official primary school age population to the education system (excluding pre-primary education). It reflects the actual level of achievement of the Universal Primary Education (UPE) goal. In fact: while the Net enrolment rate (NER) shows the coverage of pupils in the official primary school age group in the primary education level only: the NERA extends the measure to those of the official primary school age range who have reached secondary education because they might access primary education earlier than the official entrance or they might skip some grades due to their performance. Increasing NERA might mirror improving participation of children in the official primary school age: the decrease of the target population or both. A value of 100% indicates theoretically that the country has accomplished the UPE goal. However: this condition is not sufficient for UPE due to: for example: a high repetition rate: which might lead pupils to dropout after primary school age without completing primary education. The difference between NERA and NER provides a measure of the proportion of children in the official primary age group who are enrolled in secondary education.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics
